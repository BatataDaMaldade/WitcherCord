 I used cosmicsalad's Dark Matter theme as a template to this CSS, with help from Kilanna (big thanks) in helping me fix portions of CSS I botched; I'm new to this, and CSS is a nightmare. The background is from Witcher 3, and belongs to CD Projekt RED.
 
 **I HAVE DECIDED TO DISCONTINUE WORK ON MY THEMES HOWEVER I WILL NOT BE CLOSING THE REPOSITORY AS THERE HAS BEEN MANY FORKS FROM THOSE WHO ENJOYED MY THEMES THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT AND TO THOSE WHO ENJOYED WITCHERCORD**
